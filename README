To run in eclipse. Arguments are the rgb file and the .wav file

This program plays a video. And when paused or stopped can search through another video (or itself) for frames that contain
similar descriptors to the shown frame. The searches implemented are color, motion, audio.


Files:
VideoSearch.java
Main class. Does the display stuff, video stuff, indexing, etc
VideoPreProcessor.java
Does all the preprocessing of all the videos. Stored descriptors into an xml file per video. the input video is assumed to be 
amung these videos.

Instructions:
The videos to be used must be in a file named vdo in the same director as the src folder for running in Eclipse. This includes
the input video! Each video must be in its own folder with the folder the .rgb file and the .wav file having the same name

The .xml files that the PreProcessor generates that VideoSearch queries to get the descriptors of the frames should stay where
they are. Don't move them to another folder. 

To search for similar frames. The video must be paused or stopped and a video must be selected from the drop down menu to search
against. Even if a name of a video is showing in it it still must be selected. The strips show in order frames with similar color,
motion, and audio levels. Frames can be clicked to play the searched video from that frame.
